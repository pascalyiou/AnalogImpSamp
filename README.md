This folder contains:
1. an R script to perform simulations of analogue importance sampling to simulate ensembles of extreme heatwaves
2. an sh script to run he R script in batch, on parallel computers
3. An input data file of mean daily temperatures in five European stations, from the ECA&D database
4. Two R scripts to analyze the output and make figures
