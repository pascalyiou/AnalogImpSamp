# AnalogImpSamp
Simulation of extreme events with Analogue Importance Sampling
This folder contains:
1. an R script to perform simulations of analogue importance sampling to simulate ensembles of extreme heatwaves
2. a sh script to run he R script in batch, on parallel computers
3. An input data file of mean daily temperatures in five European stations, from the ECA&D database

The files are provided "as is" under a CeCILL free licence. For commercial use, please contact Pascal Yiou (pascal.yiou@lsce.ipsl.fr)
